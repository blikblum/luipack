* Isolated CreateParams function
* Added Failed function
* Added dummy SubtractRect function
* Replaced Canvas.TextFlags by TextStyle
* Added LResources unit
* Used the PackArray Implmentation from original port
* The TCanvas of VCL does not has width and height as LCL does. This cause conflict with "with" operator
* Implemented TOLEStream
* Fixed bug in LCL.GetScrollPos
* Fixed  Draw problems due to TCanvas.Color
* Fixed Align problems of TVirtualNode (Hint from original port)


#Major Tasks#
< > General Painting
  [ ] The NodeBitmap width/Height is not reseted when erasing the background
< > Define the UNICODE support schema. Probably change from widestring to ansistring and let LCL do the rest
  [ ] Use GetTextExtentPoint instead of GetTextExtentPoint32 since the later is a wrapper to the former in LCL
  [ ] For now all rendering will be done with DrawTextW wrapper > Windows.DrawTextW
< > Find a way to mantain OLE drag and Drop in windows
  [ ] Also maintain OLE ClipBoard?? Necessary??
< > Replace TWMTimer since is only called in win32. Or implement in GTK Intf?
< > Implement Imagelist handling
< > GetCurrentObject used for blending does not exists in LCL. Add it?
  [ ] Gtk.GetObject does not return dmBits (is always nil)
< > Implement the header
  [ ] BevelEdges is used to paint the Header. See if is worth implementing it
  [ ] Process the header messages or do another way
  [ ] See if DestroyWindowHandle is necessary in Destroy
< > Bidi Support
  [ ]Properly Implement TBaseVirtualTree.UseRightToLeftAlignment
#Secondary Tasks#
< > (low) OleAcc: MSAA (Accessibility)
< > WMContextMenu: replace by DoContextPopup??. Add to LCL??
  [ ] Fix Double MouseRUp
  [ ] in line 2042 of callback simplify
< > pceltFetched in TEnumFormatEtc.Next is declared as ULong in fpc but PLongInt in Delphi
< > Implement THintWindow.IsHintMsg ?
< > Add TLMEnable ??
< > Replace WMSetFont since LM_SETFONT is not used in LCL
<*> Replace RaiseLastOSError. Is used in only one place -> Removed
< > IsWinNT is currently set to True. See if will support win98 and how do it
< > See what todo with GetTextAlign. Implement in LCL??
< > Thread support
  [ ] Replace TVTCriticalSection by SyncObjs.TCriticalSection??
  [ ] See appropriate value for INFINITE constant in Linux/BSD etc
< > TWorkerThread.ChangeTreeStates uses SendMessage. See if it works both in win and linux
< > In fpc TStgMedium records have PunkForRelease instead of unkForRelease, same for stm and stg
< > Add a way to replace TBitmap.Scanline and all advanced graphics routines
  [ ] Use TLazIntfImage?
  [ ] Properly implement CreatePatternBrush or find a way to paint the lines
< > Implement GetBkColor in LCL
< > Begin/EndUpdate uses WM_SETREDRAW  message to avoid painting. See a crossplatform way of doing it
<*> Translate MAKEROP4 from C to Pascal. Done copied from fpc
< > TCMMouseWheel is not used in Lazarus. Remove
< > Revise CM* functions and messages
< > Implement SubtractRect
< > Implement WMSetFont
< > Implement PackArray using asm
  [ ] Wait for fpc2.2
  [ ] Adapt for fpc
  [ ] Create versions for not i386

#Checks#
< > See if getting the length of PWideChar by typecasting to WideString is correct
< > See if the Hint is being show in the correct place
< > See the effect of using RecreateWnd (in TCustomVirtualTreeOptions.SetMiscOptions)
< > WM_NCPAINT: see the behavior under LCL
< > TVMGet* functions: probably it can be ignored, since is windows specific and not necessary at all
< > See if WM_COPY can be mapped to LM_COPYTOCLIP
< > See WM_ENABLE,WM_GETDLGCODE behavior under lcl/win32
< > See function of WM_GETOBJECT and if is necessary to add to LCL
< > See the difference between TWMPaint and TLMPaint
< > TWMPrint and WM_PRINT. See if is necessary
< > In SetCursor uses TLMessage. Investigate
< > See if GetRGBColor is necessary. Probably not. If so remove color constants
< > Found no way to replace ValidateRect in Hint Window animation. See a way to replace it
< > See if the typecasts to longword in TVirtualTreeColumn.LoadFromStream is correct
< > See te meaning of Bevel* properties see what values it should be in LCL
< > See if MapWindowPoints is returning correct values
< > See if Application.ProcessMessages in InterruptValidation will work (WM_QUIT handling??)
< > see if windows.GetUpdateRect is equal to PaintStruct in WM Paint
< > In TWMKillfocus the code to nullify the active control is probably not necessary
< > See if DeleteObject is necessary in AdjustCursorPanning
< > See if WHEEL_ constants are valids under gtk
< > See if is necessary WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE
< > See if is necessary handle LM_SETCURSOR (not used in LCL)
< > See how replace CreateParams
< > See if Canvas Respect TextStyle properties and if is necessary to set the bk in PaintNormalText
< > IStream.SetSize expects ULARGE_INTEGER instead of LARGE_INTEGER
< > Remove  TRect copy in FillRect
< > In paint tree avoid using TBitmap.Canvas since it does a check each time is called
< > Why there's a extra 1 in the NodeBitmap that clears the backGround
< > See code duplicate in TBitmap.SetWidthHeight
< > Document problem of TCanvas.Color
